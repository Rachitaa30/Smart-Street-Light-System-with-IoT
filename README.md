# Smart-Street-Light-System-with-IoT
The Smart Street Light System is designed to automatically control street lighting based on ambient light and motion detection, helping to conserve energy and improve road safety. The system uses sensors (LDR and PIR) to intelligently switch or dim lights depending on the environment and presence of vehicles or pedestrians.
