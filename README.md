# Smart-Street-Light-System-with-IoT
The Smart Street Light System is designed to automatically control street lighting based on ambient light and motion detection, helping to conserve energy and improve road safety. The system uses sensors (LDR and PIR) to intelligently switch or dim lights depending on the environment and presence of vehicles or pedestrians.

Features
 Automatic ON/OFF based on day and night using LDR.
 Motion detection with PIR sensor to brighten lights only when movement is detected.
 Energy-saving dim mode (25% brightness during no motion).
 Solar-powered operation (optional).
 Wi-Fi control and data monitoring (optional with ESP8266).
 LCD Display to show status of lights and sensors (optional feature).

Components used:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Breadboard
3. LDR Sensor Module
4. PIR Sensor Module
5. I2C LCD 16x2 Display
6. LED (Street Light)
7. 220Î© Resistor
8. 9V/12V DC Power Supply
9. Jumper Wires
